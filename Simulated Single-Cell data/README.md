# Simulated Single-Cell data
In this folder you cand find various types of simulations, dimensionality reduction methods and clustering algorithms. Also, you can find the comparison through Jaccard Score of the original simulated groups and detected groups.
The codes are divided in clustering algorithms (K-Means, K Nearest Neighbours + Louvain, Shared Nearest Neighbours + Louvain). Inside of each you can find three types of simulation (batches, groups and trajectories) and three dimensionality reduction methods (Principal Component Analysis, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).
